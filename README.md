[Graphene](http://graphene-python.org) is a Python library for building GraphQL schemas/types fast and easily.

- **Easy to use:** Graphene helps you use GraphQL in Python without effort.
- **Relay:** Graphene has builtin support for Relay.
- **Data agnostic:** Graphene supports any kind of data source: SQL (Django, SQLAlchemy), NoSQL, custom Python objects, etc.
  We believe that by providing a complete API you could plug Graphene anywhere your data lives and make your data available
  through GraphQL.


## Integrations

Graphene has multiple integrations with different frameworks:

| integration   |   Package |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Django        |  [graphene-django](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene-django/)  |
| SQLAlchemy    |  [graphene-sqlalchemy](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene-sqlalchemy/)  |
| Google App Engine    |  [graphene-gae](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene-gae/)  |
| Peewee    |  *In progress* ([Tracking Issue](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene/issues/289))  |

Also, Graphene is fully compatible with the GraphQL spec, working seamlessly with all GraphQL clients, such as [Relay](https://github.com/facebook/relay), [Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) and [gql](https://github.com/graphql-python/gql).

## Installation

For instaling graphene, just run this command in your shell

```bash
pip install "graphene>=1.0"
```

## 1.0 Upgrade Guide

Please read [UPGRADE-v1.0.md](/UPGRADE-v1.0.md) to learn how to upgrade.


## Examples

Here is one example for you to get started:

```python
class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    hello = graphene.String(description='A typical hello world')

    def resolve_hello(self, args, context, info):
        return 'World'

schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)
```

Then Querying `graphene.Schema` is as simple as:

```python
query = '''
    query SayHello {
      hello
    }
'''
result = schema.execute(query)
```

## Contributing

After cloning this repo, ensure dependencies are installed by running:

```sh
pip install -e ".[test]"
```

After developing, the full test suite can be evaluated by running:

```sh
py.test graphene --cov=graphene --benchmark-skip # Use -v -s for verbose mode
```

You can also run the benchmarks with:

```sh
py.test graphene --benchmark-only
```


### Documentation

The documentation is generated using the excellent [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/) and a custom theme.

The documentation dependencies are installed by running:

```sh
cd docs
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then to produce a HTML version of the documentation:

```sh
make html
```
