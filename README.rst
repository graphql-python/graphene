`Graphene <http://graphene-python.org>`__ is a Python library for
building GraphQL schemas/types fast and easily.

-  **Easy to use:** Graphene helps you use GraphQL in Python without
   effort.
-  **Relay:** Graphene has builtin support for Relay
-  **Django:** Automatic *Django model* mapping to Graphene Types. Check
   a fully working
   `Django <http://github.com/graphql-python/swapi-graphene>`__
   implementation

Graphene also supports *SQLAlchemy*!

*What is supported in this Python version?* **Everything**: Interfaces,
ObjectTypes, Scalars, Unions and Relay (Nodes, Connections), in addition
to queries, mutations and subscriptions.

**NEW**!: `Try graphene
online <http://graphene-python.org/playground/>`__

Installation
------------

For instaling graphene, just run this command in your shell

.. code:: bash

    pip install graphene
    # In case of need Django model support
    pip install graphene[django]
    # Or in case of need SQLAlchemy support
    pip install graphene[sqlalchemy]

Examples
--------

Here is one example for get you started:

.. code:: python

    class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
        hello = graphene.String(description='A typical hello world')
        ping = graphene.String(description='Ping someone',
                               to=graphene.String())

        def resolve_hello(self, args, context, info):
            return 'World'

        def resolve_ping(self, args, context, info):
            return 'Pinging {}'.format(args.get('to'))

    schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)

Then Querying ``graphene.Schema`` is as simple as:

.. code:: python

    query = '''
        query SayHello {
          hello
          ping(to:"peter")
        }
    '''
    result = schema.execute(query)
