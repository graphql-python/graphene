class NonNull(Structure):

    Non-Null Modifier

    A non-null is a kind of type marker, a wrapping type which points to another
    type. Non-null types enforce that their values are never null and can ensure
    an error is raised if this ever occurs during a request. It is useful for
    fields which you can make a strong guarantee on non-nullability, for example
    usually the id field of a database row will never be null.

    Note: the enforcement of non-nullability occurs within the executor.
