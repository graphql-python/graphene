File uploading
==============

File uploading is not part of the official GraphQL spec yet and is not natively
implemented in Graphene.

If your server needs to support file uploading then you can use the library: `graphene-file-upload <https://github.com/lmcgartland/graphene-file-upload>`_ which enhances Graphene to add file
uploads and conforms to the unoffical GraphQL `multipart request spec <https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec>`_.
