# Graphene Roadmap

In order to move Graphene and the GraphQL Python ecosystem forward I realized is essential to be clear with the community on next steps, so we can move uniformly.

_ðŸ‘‹ If you have more ideas on how to move the Graphene ecosystem forward, don't hesistate to [open a PR](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene/edit/master/ROADMAP.md)_

## Graphene 3

The goal is to summarize the different improvements that Graphene will need to accomplish for version 3.

In a nushell, Graphene 3 should take the Python 3 integration one step forward while still maintaining compatibility with Python 2.
