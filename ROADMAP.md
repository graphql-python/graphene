# GraphQL Python Roadmap

In order to move Graphene and the GraphQL Python ecosystem forward it's essential to be clear with the community on next steps, so we can move uniformly.

_üëã If you have more ideas on how to move the Graphene ecosystem forward, don't hesistate to [open a PR](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene/edit/master/ROADMAP.md)_


## Now
- [ ] Continue to support v2.x with security releases
- [ ] Last major/feature release is cut and graphene-* libraries should pin to that version number

## Next
New features will only be developed on version 3 of ecosystem libraries.

### [Core-Next](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core-next)
Targeted as v3 of [graphql-core](https://pypi.org/project/graphql-core/), Python 3 only

### Graphene
- [ ] Integrate with the core-next API and resolve all breaking changes
- [ ] GraphQL types from type annotations - [See issue](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene/issues/729)
- [ ] Add support for coroutines in Connection, Mutation (abstracting out Promise requirement) - [See PR](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene/pull/824)

### Graphene-*
- [ ] Integrate with the graphene core-next API and resolve all breaking changes

### *-graphql
- [ ] Integrate with the graphql core-next API and resolve all breaking changes

## Ongoing Initiatives
- [ ] Improve documentation, especially for new users to the library
- [ ] Recipes for ‚Äúquick start‚Äù that people can ideally use/run
